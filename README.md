# LSTMPdM

Predictive Maintenance for Vehicles using LSTM Autoencoders

---

## Overview

This repository provides a framework for implementing predictive maintenance (PdM) on vehicles using LSTM Autoencoders. By leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the code detects anomalies and potential failures in vehicle sensor data before breakdowns occur.

## Key Features

- **LSTM Autoencoder Modeling:** Learns normal patterns in vehicle sensor data and identifies deviations indicative of potential faults.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Flags unusual behavior that may signal early equipment degradation, helping to anticipate maintenance needs.
- **Data-Driven Approach:** Uses historical sensor data to build and evaluate robust predictive models.
- **Jupyter Notebooks & Python Code:** Interactive notebooks guide users through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:** Import and preprocess vehicle sensor data which is decoded from CAN bus.
2. **Model Training:** Train an LSTM Autoencoder to recognize normal operational patterns.
3. **Anomaly Detection:** Use reconstruction error from the autoencoder to detect and flag anomalies that may indicate maintenance needs.
4. **Visualization:** Plot results to illustrate detected anomalies and model performance.

## Technology Stack

- **Jupyter Notebook** (main development environment)
- **Python** (core logic and modeling)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** or **PyTorch** (deep learning frameworks)
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib** (data processing and visualization)
